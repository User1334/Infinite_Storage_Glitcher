# Infinite_Storage_Glitcher

A Python-based tool for converting files to videos and back. This program leverages GPU acceleration and preserves metadata such as the creation and modification dates of the files.

## üìú Description

## This program is currently only compatible with macOS on Apple M1/M2.

`Infinite_Storage_Glitcher` enables:
- **Convert file to video:** 
  - Files are converted into a black-and-white video.
  - The binary data of the file is stored in the frames of the video.
  - Metadata such as creation and modification dates are embedded in the video.

- **Reconstruct file from video:**
  - The program reads the frames from the video and reconstructs the original file.
  - Metadata is extracted from the video and applied to the file.

## üìã Examples

Convert file to video:

```bash
python3 converter.py
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Enter the path to the desired file: /path/to/file.txt
Enter the path for the output video (without .mov): /path/to/video
```

Reconstruct file from video:

```bash
python3 converter.py
Enter 1 or 2: 2
Enter the path to the video: /path/to/video.mov
Enter the path for the output file: /path/to/reconstructed/file.txt
```
